# FFDI Analysis and Plotting Tools

This repository contains various Python and R scripts used for analyzing and visualizing fire weather data, specifically focusing on the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) and its relationships with meteorological drivers. The repository includes code for calculating and plotting FFDI thresholds, time between FFDI categories, consensus plots, and percentiles for regional analysis. 

## Repository Structure

### Files

- **`ffdi_variables_analysis.py`**  
  Code for background processing, preparing the data for plotting and fitting relationships between FFDI and its drivers.

- **`Variables_Analysis3.ipynb`**  
  Jupyter Notebook for plotting and fitting relationships between FFDI and its drivers.

- **`calc_consensus_plots.py`**  
  Written by Inika Taylor (Jan 2020) to create consensus plots, adapted from Chris Kent's consensus code. Generates consensus plots based on the processed FFDI data.

- **`calc_threshold_exceedance.py`**  
  Calculates the number of times the FFDI exceeds a specified daily threshold for each 20-year period of interest (threshold exceedance).

- **`centile_calc_table_cp.py`**  
  (Feb 2020) Reads in anomalies of the number of days above the FFDI threshold, averages for a region, and calculates the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles. Outputs these values in a table for each FFDI category.

- **`ffdi_time_between_vals_v2.r`**  
  R script that plots the amount of time in each FFDI category for each region, using the Python script `calc_threshold_exceedance.py`.

- **`mass_comands.sh`**  
  Shell script that grabs data off Mass and runs the relevant initial commands for executing the rest of the analysis. If you already have the data downloaded, you just need to run the following two commands separately:

  ```bash
  python calc_threshold_exceedance.py
  python calc_consensus_plots.py
  ```

  
## Usage

### Requirements
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- R (for `ffdi_time_between_vals_v2.r`)
- Relevant Python packages (listed below)
- Bash shell (for running `mass_comands.sh`)

### Setup and Execution

#### Running the Python Scripts
To run the primary Python analysis scripts, ensure you have all required libraries installed (such as NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and any other dependencies). Once your environment is set up:

1. **Process the data for threshold exceedance**.

2. **Generate consensus plots**.

#### Running the R Script
The R script (`ffdi_time_between_vals_v2.r`) can be used to visualize the time spent in each FFDI category. Make sure you have R installed and the necessary libraries available.

Run the R script by executing:
  ```bash
  Rscript ffdi_time_between_vals_v2.r
  ```


#### Running the Shell Script (`mass_comands.sh`)
If you have your data already, simply run the following command to grab the necessary data and run the initial scripts for processing:


```bash
bash mass_comands.sh
```


This script will automatically download data and execute the relevant analysis steps (running `calc_threshold_exceedance.py` and `calc_consensus_plots.py`).

## Output

The scripts will generate various outputs, including:

- Consensus plots
- Tables of threshold exceedance
- Percentile calculations for FFDI anomalies

### Notes

- Make sure to properly configure any file paths in the scripts for your environment.
- If you encounter any errors or unexpected behavior, please refer to the script documentation or create an issue in the GitHub repository.
